"""adapter_spec: ModelAdapterSpec — the shared model-adapter data contract.

One ``ModelAdapterSpec`` per model family declares the architecture
identity and the family's adapter providers (structure replacements,
attention contract, checkpoint mapping, model-specific TP/CP/EP rules).
The generic builders receive the spec through ``models/registry.py`` —
they never branch on model class names themselves (05 §15.9 step 1,
adjust doc §4/§7.2). This module holds only the data contract, never
model-class-name branches.

Provider fields stay ``None`` until the family's adapter modules land
(Qwen3-MoE: replacements/attention in M2, distributed rules in M3).

    """Architecture identity + adapter providers for one model family.

    Attributes:
        architecture: HF ``config.architectures[0]`` (e.g.
            ``"Qwen3MoeForCausalLM"``); native (non-HF) models register
            their own model class name here.
        model_type: HF ``config.model_type`` (e.g. ``"qwen3_moe"``) — the
            registry lookup key.
        replacements: provider returning the family's module-replacement
            declarations (pointing at the generic high-performance
            ``modules`` entries — never re-implementing kernels).
        attention: provider returning the family's attention contract
            (parameter names, mask/cache/forward adaptation).
        checkpoint: provider returning family-specific checkpoint
            key/layout mappings, when the generic mapping is insufficient.
        materialization: provider accepting the constructed model and registering
            deterministic derived buffers or state hooks before sharding and
            ``to_empty()``. This supports unmodified native HF model classes.
        context_parallel: provider returning the family's CP wrappers.
        expert_parallel: provider returning the family's EP compute
            factories.
        sharding_rules: provider returning the family's planner naming-rule
            overrides — ``[(pattern | [patterns], ParamRole), ...]`` checked
            before the default naming rules in Phase 1 (e.g. DeepSeek MLA's
            replicated down-projections). Lives here so the generic planner
            never carries per-family knowledge.
        fsdp_wrap_modules: provider accepting the built model and returning
            exact module FQNs that form additional FSDP child units. Use this
            for non-decoder execution branches such as a vision tower or
            multimodal projector; the generic HF decoder discovery remains the
            default when this provider is absent.
        fsdp_excluded_subtrees: provider returning exact module FQNs whose
            subtrees must not be interpreted as HF decoder containers. The
            adapter may still declare nested FSDP units inside those branches.
        fsdp_execution_order: provider accepting the built model and every
            selected child-unit FQN, then returning their first-forward
            execution order. This lets conditional multimodal models override
            module-registration order for FSDP communication prefetching.
        recompute: provider returning normal-training activation-checkpoint
            policy. This must not depend on validation-only imports.
        validation: lazy provider returning the family's ``ModelValidationSpec``.
            Normal training never calls it; authoritative repositories and
            validation-only dependencies therefore stay outside import paths.
        loss: provider returning model-family output-loss adapters that must
            intercept the model before a full terminal output is materialized.
